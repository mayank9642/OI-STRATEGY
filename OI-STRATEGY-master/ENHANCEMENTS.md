- Added logging of sample symbols for verification

### 2. Enhanced Market Hour Checks
- Added thorough checks for market open/close times
- Added weekend detection
- Added simple holiday detection
- Improved time-based logic for 9:20 AM analysis

### 3. Simplified Position Sizing for Paper Trading
- Set fixed position size of 1 lot for all trades
- Removed account equity checks for paper trading
- Streamlined trade execution process
- Added paper trade flag in trade history

### 4. Improved Trade Management
- Enhanced exit conditions tracking (stoploss, target, time-based)
- Added detailed P&L calculation for trades
- Created comprehensive trade history logging
- Fixed strike price extraction from symbols

### 5. Added Performance Tracking & Reporting
- Created daily summary reports
- Added CSV export of trade history
- Implemented end-of-day reporting
- Stored historical trade data

### 6. Created Web Dashboard
- Built interactive Dash application for monitoring
- Added real-time P&L chart
- Added trade history table
- Created daily statistics display
- Created convenience scripts to launch dashboard

## How to Use

### Running the Strategy
1. Run authentication: `.\run_auth.ps1` or `run_auth.bat`
2. Run the main strategy: `python src\main.py`

### Viewing Performance Dashboard
1. Run the dashboard: `.\run_dashboard.ps1` or `run_dashboard.bat`
2. Open your browser to: http://localhost:8050

## Advanced Simulation & Backtesting Features

### 1. Enhanced Simulation Capabilities
- Created `src/enhanced_simulation.py` with the ability to simulate strategy for any date/time
- Implemented multiple market scenario templates (bullish, bearish, volatile, range-bound)
- Added ability to simulate strategy across multiple time points in a day
- Created realistic option chain data generation with proper volatility and OI characteristics

### 2. Historical Data & Backtesting
- Added `src/backtest_strategy.py` for comprehensive backtesting across date ranges
- Implemented historical data fetching from Fyers API when available
- Added data caching to improve performance and reduce API calls
- Created performance metrics calculation and reporting

### 3. Testing & Debugging Tools
- Added scripts to test option chain fetching directly
- Created `src/fetch_option_oi.py` for real-time OI analysis
- Improved logging throughout the codebase

### How to Use Simulation & Backtesting

#### Enhanced Simulation
- Run `.\run_enhanced_simulation.ps1` or `run_enhanced_simulation.bat`
- Optionally specify date and time: `.\run_enhanced_simulation.ps1 -date "2023-04-25" -time "09:20"`
- For multiple time points: `.\run_enhanced_simulation.ps1 -date "2023-04-25" -multiple`

#### Backtesting
- Run `.\run_backtest.ps1` or `run_backtest.bat`
- Specify date range: `.\run_backtest.ps1 -start "2023-04-01" -end "2023-04-30"`
- Results are saved in `data/backtest/` directory

## Next Steps
1. Integrate with additional data sources for more accurate historical data
2. Implement additional technical indicators for entry/exit
3. Add SMS/email notifications for trade alerts
4. Create parameter optimization tools
5. Implement automatic exchange holiday calendar
